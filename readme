Just a quick exercise in making quicksort a parallel ordeal.

The 'Rules':
- Your solution must work with 1GB of memory or less.
- Your solution must output a file called 'sorted' in the data dir. It should be a comma separated list, with an extra comma at the end. 
- Your solution file must be the exact same size as the unsorted file.
- Your solution should be able to sort a file of any size, hard drive space permitting. 
- You are free to use another language, algorithm, virtual machine, etc.
